- 👋 Hi, I’m @unicoherent
- 👀 I’m interested in ... lots of things! but top interest of the moment is graphing topological spaces (or mathematical fucntions, objects, systems, etc) and converting the output to svg format
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... responsive design for webpages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure, but open to ideas! I always welcome feedback (IF WORDED KINDLY!) on how I can improve my unicoherent.com website, and am willing to give whatever sort of help I can for YOUR project in return. People have found my input extremely useful in the past as someone who analyzes websites and gives feedback for how they can be improved both visually and functionally as well as helping people making UIs more intuitive. In terms of coding I do not know a lot so my usefulness as an actual code-collaborator (as opposed to design collaborator) might be mostly acting the "rubber-duck" role.
